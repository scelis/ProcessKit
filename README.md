# ProcessKit

This is a simple library I wrote to make it easier for Swift scripts to work with the [`Process`](https://developer.apple.com/reference/foundation/process) class.

## Installation

You can include this library in your own projects by using the [Swift Package Manager](https://swift.org/package-manager/).
